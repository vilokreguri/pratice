# Azure Pipelines YAML - Design Docs

The design docs within this repo are created at different times during the development of Azure Pipelines, to support collaborative contributions to the design process. Designs documents are for,

* features considered for implementation but never implemented
* already implemented features
* future ideas for features

The design docs in this repo may not represent the current state of an Azure Pipelines feature. 

For the most upto date information about a feature refer to the [Azure Pipeline Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops) and specifically the [Azure Pipeline Yaml Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema)
